      <p>
        Some things about me, I am a musician focused mainly in hip-hop with inspiration of heavy metal and dubstep influences.

      <p>
        I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember and would assume most of my classmates are aware of my affinity for the Legend of Zelda franchise.

      <p>
        I am also the brave owner of a Shiba Inu puppy named Winter; infamous for pulling too hard on his leash, chewing on things he is not supposed to, and jumping on everyone he meets (which is not normal shiba behavior).
